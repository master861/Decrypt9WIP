XML loader example for use with Brahma2Loader / *hax 2.5+
=========================================================

Introduced with *hax 2.5, the HB launcher can now use XML files to
load .3DSX binaries with start parameters. This folder contains one
sample XML folder (for autoloading the ReiNAND CFW via Brahma2Loader)
and another folder containing a Microsoft Windows batch script to
easily generate SMDH icon/description files yourself. 

If you just want to try it :
- Make sure your *hax is up to date, see here: http://smealum.github.io/3ds/
- Have BrahmaLoader ("BrahmaLoader.3dsx"/".smdh") installed in /3DS/BrahmaLoader/
- Copy "reinand.xml" and "reinand.smdh" to /3DS/
- Also make sure you have the ReiNAND CFW installed ("reiNand.dat" in root)
- You have a new entry in your HB launcher, use it to boot ReiNAND via Brahma

If you want to make your own:
- Open reinand.xml in a text editor of your choice
- In <args>, put "[PAYLOAD_PATH] [OFFSET_HEX] [MAX_SIZE_HEX] [VOODOO]"
  note (1): A maximum size of zero means that max size should not be checked
  note (2): [VOODOO] is a hex value between 00 and 3F that might help increase
  boot success rates, possibly good values are 00, 03, 08, 0B, 0C and 0F
  note (3): [MAX_SIZE_HEX], [OFFSET_HEX] and [VOODOO] are optional, just
  "/Decrypt9.bin" would be valid as well (this would load from offset 0)
- If you want a custom icon, put the path to your SMDH into <icon>
- You may put the Brahma2Loader somewhere else, just change <executable>
- It is highy recommended to rename reinand.xml to something more fitting

Creating SMDHs? It's easy... (Windows only)
- Check out the folder called "zzz_create_smdh"
- Here, replace the icon.png with a 48x48 icon of your choice
- Open the file called "create_smdh.bat" in a text editor of your choice
- Here, replace the names/descriptions/paths as you see fit, then save
- Run "create_smdh.bat" via a double click in Windows Explorer
