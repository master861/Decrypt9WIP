Example programs for use with Brahma
====================================

This folder contains projects and example source code for
ARM9 payload binaries (running at ARM9 SVC mode) which can be
built using devkitARM. The resulting payload files can be loaded
using one of the methods supported by the Brahma privilege
elevation exploit for the Nintendo 3DS system.

How to use:
- Download Brahma (https://github.com/patois/Brahma/releases)
- Run brahma.3dsx using homebrew launcher
- Use one of the methods supported by Brahma in order to load
  the payload

How to build:
- Download and install devkitARM (http://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started)
- Open a shell and run 'make' in order to build the payload binary

  infrastructure along with Decrypt9/bootstrap that this project is based on.
